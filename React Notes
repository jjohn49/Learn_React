-React is a JS Library for user interfaces

-React is all about components 
    -Components = Swift view but in React
    -Compnents can be reused
    -Seperation of concerns (file for each component or tasks)

-How components are built
    -React is mostly HTML ands JS
    -React is a Declarative approach
        -Tellr act the end state and React figures out what to do

-React set up
    1.Create a repository (preferably set it up w/ GitHub) (need Node)
    2.run commands:
        npx create-react-app {Insert desired react app name}
        cd {React App name}
        npm start
    [Note that this will give you a lot of unneccessary starter code that can be deleted]
    
-About the React Code
    -The main file is the index file (first file to be executed)
    -Where yous specify the root div
    -The App.js file is the main component
    -Index renders App
    -React vs React Dom
        2 seperate packages but together create the React Library
    -Index.html (in the public folder) is the only html file to be loaded by React
        -This is where the root div is created (the one that is specified in Index.js)

-JSX = JS XML
    -The html in JavaScript

-Try to do one file per component

-Only render the App component in Index.js
    -Everything else can be called in App.js or sub component of App component
